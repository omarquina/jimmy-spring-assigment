Assignment:

Car Reservation API

The goal of the application is to reserve cars for upcoming rides. 

As a user of the system, you can add cars where each car is represented by its make, model and unique identifier following the pattern “C<number>”. 

Besides adding a new car, a user can also update one, remove one, or see all the cars (no pagination needed). 

The last step in the flow is the ability to reserve a car for a ride at a certain time and duration. The reservation can be taken up to 24 hours ahead and the duration can take up to 2 hours. The system should find an available car, store the reservation if possible and give back a response with the details. The user can also see all the upcoming reservations by calling another dedicated endpoint. 

The communication is only via API in the JSON format and the data can be stored just in the memory. The application doesn’t need to implement a concept of users (data is shared).

The solution should clearly represent your architectural knowledge and follow the best practices overall including loose coupling and automated testing.

Technical Requirements:

* Java/Kotlin

* Spring Boot or Ktor

* Automated tests

* REST API + documentation

* Docker
